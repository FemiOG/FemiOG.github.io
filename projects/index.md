## Credit Card Fraud Detection  

A binary classification problem that involved using logistic regression to determine whether a card transaction is fraudulent or not.   

- The goal of the project was to create a model using a credit card transaction dataset from kaggle and have the model predict whether a card transaction was fraudulent or not.
- I succesfully built a logistic regression model using Python and Scikit-Learn with an Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) score of 97% which was a major improvement over the 71% AUPRC score of the baseline model.

## Loan Risk Model 

Competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-nigeria-credit-risk-prediction) by Data Science Nigeria & OneFi Co (Credit Lending Company) to predict whether a customer would default on a loan.  

- The goal was to predict whether a customer would default on a loan. 
- I used Python and Scikit-Learn to build a model with an accuracy of 77.8% 

I came in 6th position out of 48 participants.

## Customer Segmentation

Reviewed unstructured data to understand the patterns and natural categories that the data fits into. Used multiple algorithms and both empirically and theoretically compared and contrasted their results. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.

## Finding Donors for CharityML  

- The goal of the project was to investigate factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data.
- I developed a naive classifier with Accuracy 24.78% and F-score 0.2917 to compare testing results to.
- I trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. 
- I selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency which was a logistic regression model with an Accuracy of 84.19% and an F-score of 0.6832.
